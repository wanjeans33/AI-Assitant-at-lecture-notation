## 1. Introduction to Bitcoin and Blockchain

### Decentralization
> **Decentralization** refers to the distribution of control across a network of nodes, eliminating single points of failure.
- Traditional systems (e.g., banks) have centralized control, making them vulnerable to breaches.
- Blockchain operates on a decentralized network, where multiple nodes validate transactions, ensuring security and resilience.

### Inclusivity
- Bitcoin and blockchain technology are **inclusive**, allowing anyone with internet access to participate in the network.
- No reliance on intermediaries like banks; transactions can occur directly between parties.

### Trustless Transactions
- Blockchain enables **trustless transactions**, where parties can transact without needing to trust each other or a central authority.
- Transactions are verified by the network, ensuring transparency and security.

---

## 2. Institutional Adoption of Crypto

### JP Morgan's Shift
- Initially, JP Morgan's CEO dismissed Bitcoin as a scam.
- Later, JP Morgan embraced Bitcoin, offering clients exposure to crypto assets, reflecting a **learning process** in institutional adoption.

### Stablecoins and Traditional Finance
- **Stablecoins** (e.g., USDT) are being adopted by traditional financial institutions like Deutsche Bank for **on-chain finance**.
- Stablecoins enable **24/7 transactions** and reduce costs compared to traditional payment systems like Visa.

### Regulatory Changes (SEC and Bitcoin ETFs)
- The SEC, under Gary Gensler, approved **Bitcoin ETFs**, allowing institutional money to flow into crypto.
- This regulatory shift has increased **liquidity** and **trust** in the crypto ecosystem.

---

## 3. Cryptography Basics

### Kerckhoffs's Principle
> **Kerckhoffs's Principle** states that a cryptographic system should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.
- Security relies on the secrecy of the **key**, not the algorithm.

### Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption (e.g., Caesar Cipher, Enigma Machine).
  - Weakness: Requires secure key exchange.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption (e.g., RSA).
  - Public key encrypts, private key decrypts (or vice versa for digital signatures).

### Public and Private Keys
- **Public Key**: Used to receive crypto assets (like a bank account number).
- **Private Key**: Used to send crypto assets (like a password or PIN).
  - Must be kept secret; losing it means losing access to assets.

---

## 4. Trust and Cryptography

### Building Trust in Decentralized Systems
- Cryptography enables trust in **insecure environments** like the internet.
- **Digital Signatures** verify the identity of the sender, ensuring the message is authentic.

### Digital Signatures and Identity Verification
- A message is encrypted with the sender's **private key** and the recipient's **public key**.
- The recipient decrypts the message using their **private key** and the sender's **public key**, verifying the sender's identity.

---

## 5. Practical Applications

### Wallets and Custody
- **Wallets** are software that manage private and public keys.
- **Custodians** are entities that manage crypto assets on behalf of users, requiring access to private keys.

### Key Generation
- Keys can be generated using **true random number generators** (e.g., moving the mouse to create random input).
- Public keys are derived from private keys using **hashing algorithms** (e.g., SHA-256).

### Real-World Examples
- **WhatsApp**: Uses end-to-end encryption, where each user has a unique key pair for each contact.
- **Online Banking**: Uses HTTPS (asymmetric encryption) to secure transactions.

---

## 6. Historical Context

### Caesar Cipher
- One of the oldest encryption methods, using a fixed offset to shift letters.
- Weakness: Easy to break with brute force (trying all possible offsets).

### Enigma Machine
- Used by the Nazis in WWII, it employed **symmetric encryption** with rotating offsets.
- Weakness: Once the key was compromised, all messages could be decrypted.

### Modern Cryptography (RSA, SHA-256)
- **RSA**: An asymmetric encryption algorithm developed in the 1970s, still widely used today.
- **SHA-256**: A hashing algorithm used in Bitcoin to secure transactions and generate public keys.

---

## Glossary
- **Decentralization**: Distribution of control across a network, eliminating single points of failure.
- **Stablecoin**: A cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar.
- **Kerckhoffs's Principle**: A cryptographic system should be secure even if everything except the key is public.
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption.
- **Digital Signature**: A cryptographic method to verify the authenticity of a message.
- **Wallet**: Software that manages private and public keys for crypto transactions.
- **Custodian**: An entity that manages crypto assets on behalf of users.

## Corrected Transcription

# Lecture Transcription: Bitcoin, Cryptography, and Trust

## Introduction
Now, next up is a video that I recommend to you: **Peter Manbatenberg's "Why Bitcoin is Revolutionary"**. Did everyone get a chance to watch it? If so, maybe you can share some of your insights from the video. What were your thoughts when you heard Peter talk about Bitcoin? Anything that stood out to you? Not all at once, please. Okay, I can't handle so many responses at once. But honestly, do you remember anything that Peter said in the video?

---

## Key Points from the Video
### Decentralization of Blockchain and Bitcoin
One key point Peter mentioned was the **decentralization of blockchain and Bitcoin**. He explained that traditionally, when we make payments, there’s usually one point of failure—a single point of pressure or a security breach. If that point is compromised, the entire system can fail. But with Bitcoin and blockchain in general, we have many nodes that must agree, which is the essence of decentralization. 

### Inclusivity and Independence from Intermediaries
Another point was that Bitcoin is **very inclusive**. Anyone in the world can participate. We don’t rely on a central intermediary like a bank. If you and I agree on a transaction, we can conduct it ourselves, no matter what anyone else says or the time of day. That’s a powerful situation.

---

## Impact of Bitcoin on Organizations
It seems like the video had a lasting impact on you. Maybe next time, we’ll watch it together in class and discuss it right afterward. It appears to make a stronger impression that way.

Organizations, not just individuals, are learning about crypto. For example, the CEO of JP Morgan once called Bitcoin a scam and a Ponzi scheme. But just a couple of years later, JP Morgan is now all-in on Bitcoin. They offer their clients and institutional investors exposure to Bitcoin and other crypto assets. This shows a learning process.

---

## The Shift in the Financial Landscape
Remember the slide I shared with you about the **shift in the financial landscape**? It’s a slow shift, but it’s happening. It doesn’t happen overnight, but it’s substantial. For instance, the CEO of Visa is now scared for his own business because people are using stablecoins for global transactions. The volume of these transactions is outpacing Visa transactions. 

Crypto might seem like a small niche, but when it comes to transaction volume, it’s significant. For example, someone in Argentina can send money to the United States, Iran, or Afghanistan for a fraction of the cost. Companies like Visa and Mastercard charge between 0.3% and 3.5% per transaction. Even at 0.3%, it’s still much more expensive than crypto transactions. This is why companies like Visa are afraid of losing their business.

---

## The Rise of Stablecoins
In response, companies like Visa and Mastercard are considering launching their own stablecoins. We see this in Germany too, with players like Deutsche Bank starting their own stablecoins. Why? Because on-chain finance makes transactions easier and faster, operating 24/7. But on-chain finance also requires on-chain liquidity, which is why stablecoins are necessary. 

If you’re a registered player like Deutsche Bank, why not create your own stablecoin? You already have a huge reserve in your bank account. Let that reserve generate rewards for you. Big players are shifting their mindset because they see their business models changing.

---

## Money, Trust, and Regulation
The last slide in this chapter is about **Money and Trust**. In January 2024, the SEC, under Gary Gensler, allowed crypto ETFs to come to life. The biggest one is the **iShares Bitcoin Trust**, which I’ve talked about before. This decision allowed a lot of institutional money to flow into the crypto world. 

When you have assets on-chain, you also need liquidity on-chain. This is why the whole ecosystem needs liquidity right now.

---

## Questions and Discussion
Any questions so far? Let’s go through some statements:

1. **Blockchain is a subset of token-based CBDCs**: Not quite. Blockchain is a subset of decentralized systems, but token-based CBDCs are a different concept.
2. **Token-based CBDCs require Bitcoin**: False. Token-based CBDCs have nothing to do with Bitcoin.
3. **A token is an entry in a register**: True. A token is essentially an entry in a ledger with access controls.
4. **Blockchain is organizationally decentralized but logically centralized**: True. While there are many nodes, they all use the same software, making them logically centralized.
5. **Stablecoins are a subset of security tokens**: False. Stablecoins are a subset of payment tokens.
6. **The Bitcoin network is decentralized, and its software cannot crash**: False. The Bitcoin network is decentralized, but the software can crash.

---

## Transition to Day Two
Now, let’s transition to **Day Two** of our lecture. I’ve divided the slides into days, but for guest speakers, I need to create some movement. This is why some discussions were cut short. I’d rather finish early on Friday afternoon than run late. So, let’s jump into **Day Two**.

---

## Keys, Wallets, and Custody
The next topic is **Keys, Wallets, and Custody**. This is one of the key concepts in understanding how crypto works. 

### Trust and Cryptography
We’ve talked a lot about trust. How can we move from trust to cryptography? How can you be confident in a transaction when there’s no intermediary, and you don’t know the other party? The answer lies in **mathematics and technology**. Mathematics doesn’t depend on human action, and the core element in cryptography is **Kerckhoffs’s Principle**.

Kerckhoffs’s Principle, introduced in 1883, states that a **cryptosystem is secure if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge**. This means that everyone should know everything about the cryptosystem except the key.

---

## Cryptography vs. Encryption
It’s important to distinguish between **cryptography** and **encryption**. Cryptography is the broader concept of securing information, while encryption is a specific technique within cryptography. There are two types of encryption: **symmetric** and **asymmetric**. We’ll look at these in more detail later.

---

## The Ubiquity of Cryptography
You rely on cryptography 100% of the time when using your computer or smartphone. Whether you’re reading the news, connecting to Wi-Fi, or sending a message, cryptography is at work. For example, when you visit a website, the connection is encrypted to ensure that the person sending the information is who they claim to be.

---

## Trust in Code and Systems
But how do we trust the people who write the software code? Why do we trust the Bitcoin code or the software that runs our smartphones? We’ve never met these people, so why do we trust them? This is a fundamental question.

One answer is **social heuristics**. We trust systems because many other people use them. If a system were truly bad, people wouldn’t use it. This is the same logic we use when entering a building—we assume it won’t collapse because many people have used it before.

---

## Verifying Transactions
How can you verify that a transaction is secure? For example, how can you be sure that your bank transfer or WhatsApp message is secure? These are questions worth exploring, especially in a course like this.

---

## The Role of Experts
Ultimately, we trust experts to design secure systems. We don’t know them personally, but we assume they’re smart enough to create secure systems. As long as we don’t hear about major breaches, we continue to trust these systems.

---

## The Connection Between Trust and Cryptography
Cryptography builds trust in an insecure environment. It allows us to trust someone we’ve never met, like when sending money to someone on the other side of the world. Cryptography ensures that only the intended recipient can read the message.

---

## Practical Example: Public and Private Keys
Let’s look at a practical example using **public and private keys**. When you visit a website like Deutsche Bank, your browser checks the site’s certificate, which includes the public key. This key is used to encrypt data sent to the website. Only the website’s private key can decrypt this data.

This is how you can trust that the website is legitimate. The public key is available to everyone, but the private key is kept secret. This is the essence of **asymmetric encryption**.

---

## Creating Your Own Key Pair
Now, let’s create our own **private and public key pair**. We’ll use a website called **BitAddress.org**. You’ll move your mouse around to generate random input, which will create a truly unique key pair. This key pair has never been used before and is completely secure.

---

## Conclusion
This is the core of how crypto works. It’s a decentralized system where trust is built through cryptography. Any questions so far? Let’s take a short break and reconvene in a few minutes.
